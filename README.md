# australianpostcodes
A community sourced comprehensive database of Australian Post Codes with geolocation data.

#how it started
Some years ago, Australia Post used to publish a full list of Australian Postal Codes including state and location data, in a raw data format, completely free.

They have since stopped doing this, instead preferring to charge for data that is arguably public domain, or at least available publicly in many different forms from many different providers.

I've needed this data for a number of projects over the years, and have collated as much publicly-available postal data as I could find. There are a bunch of files out on the internet with this data, but they are all missing data or detail, so I've tried to collate them as best I can.
